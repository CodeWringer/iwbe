# Integrated World Building Environment (IWBE)
This application is designed to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive suite of tools with which to write and organize information pertaining to a (fictional) world. 

This is **not** an image/map drawing program. 

## Features
* None, yet :(

## Roadmap
* Articles - Writing and organizing information in written form. 
	* Article Templates - To speed up article creation. 
	* Article Generators - To speed up article creation even more. 
	* Linking articles - To allow quickly jumping from one piece of information to another, as needed. 
	* TODO list - To keep track of topics yet to tackle. 
	* Export - Json, HTML, xml, etc. (ideally also pdf, but that's a maybe)
* Canvas - Visualization, in the form of imported maps (as images), with articles linked to various types of symbols and geographic shapes. 
* Timeline - Visualizing history and inventing custom calendars. 
* Hierarchies - Building hierarchies of articles, to represent organizations, family trees, evolutionary paths, etc. 

## Potential Future Features
* A conlang editor/system?
